                        Example of a narrative text :<br />         <br /><br />                                                     True Friends<br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br /><br />Hope it helps:)<br />

                        The Ugly Duckling<br /><br />A long time ago on an old farm, lived a duck family. One day, Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of a new eggs. One nice morning, the eggs hatched and six beautiful yellow duckling popped out. But one egg was bigger than the rest, and it did not hatch. Mother Duck was suprised. How did it get there? ‘Tock! Tock!’ The duckling in that egg was pecking inside his shell.<br /><br />‘Did I count the eggs wrongly?’ Mother Duck wondered. Before the Mother Duck had time to think about it, the last egg hatched. A strange looking duckling with grey feathers worried Mother Duck. The ducklings grew quickly, but Mother Duck has a secret worry.<br /><br />‘I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine?’ she said to herself, shaking her head. Well, the grey dukling certainly was not pretty. He ate far more than his brothers, so that he was outgrowing the other ducklings. By the time passed by, the poor ugly duckling felt more and more unhappy. His brothers did not want to play with him. He was so clumsy, and all the farmyard animals laughed at him because he is ugly. He felt sad and lonely, while Mother Duck did her best to cheer up him.<br /><br />Then one day, the ugly duckling ran away from the farmyard. He began to question all the other birds. ‘Do you know of any ducklings with grey feathers like mine?’ But everyone shook their heads in scorn.<br /><br />‘We don’t know anyone as ugly as you,’ they said.<br /><br />The ugly duckling did not lose heart, however, and kept on asking everyone he met. Then one day, his travels took him near an old countrywoman’s cottage. The old woman caught the ugly duckling because she was thinking he was a stray goose.<br /><br />‘I’ll put this in a hutch. I hope it’s female and lays plenty of eggs!’ said the old woman, whose eyesight was poor. The ugly duckling, however, did not lay a single egg. Then hen kept frightening him. She said that the woman would cook him if he could not lay egg. The duckling was frightened.<br /><br />Then one night, the ugly duckling found the hutch door ajar, so he escaped. Once again he was all alone. He fled as far away as he could, and at dawn, he found himself in a thick bed of reeds. One day at sunrise, he saw some beautiful birds flew above him. They were white, with long slender necks, yellow beaks and large wings. They were flying south to find food and new nests.<br /><br />‘If only I could look like them, just for a day!’ said the duckling, admiringly. Finally winter came. The weather became cold and the water was frozen. The poor duckling left home to seek food in the snow. He was exhausted and dropped to the ground. Luckily, a farmer found him and put him in his big jacket pocket. The farmer and his children look after him well.<br /><br />However, by springtime, he had grown so big that the farmer decided. ‘I’ll set him free by the pond!’ That was when the duckling saw himself mirrored in the water.<br /><br />‘Goodness! How I have changed! I hardly recognize myself!’ He was surprised because he became a beautiful duckling.<br /><br />The flight of swans flew north again and glided on to the pond. The duckling realized he was one of their kind when he saw them, and soon made friends.<br /><br />‘We’re swans like you!’ they said, warmly. ‘Where have you been hiding?’<br /><br />‘It’s a long story,’ the young swan replied, still astounded. Now, he swam majestically with his fellow swans. One day, he heard children on the river bank exclaim: ‘Look at that young swan! He is the finestof them all!’<br /><br /><br />Question:<br /><br />1.How was the duckling like when he came out of the last egg?<br />2.Did the duckling’s brother behave well towards him?<br />3.Why did the ugly duckling leave from the farmyard?<br />4.Who caught the duckling after he had left the farmyard?<br />5.What did the hen do when the duckling couldn’t lay egg?<br />6.Who took care of the duckling well?<br />7.Who was actually the young swan?<br />8.Can you mention the characters in the story?<br /><br /><br />Kunci Jawaban:<br /><br />1.He had grey feathers.

                        Narrative Text<p><strong>JAWABAN:</strong></p><p>Snow White</p><p><strong>1. Orientation</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess. She was very beautiful, with blue eyes and long black hair. Her skin was smooth and white, so she was called Snow White. Snow White had a stepmother who was always jealous of Snow White's beauty. Her stepmother was also very pretty, and the magic mirror said this every day, every time she asked that.
</p><p><strong>2. Complication</strong></p><p>One day, her stepmother asked the magic mirror which woman was the most beautiful in the country and the magic mirror said Snow White was the most beautiful in the country. The stepmother was very angry. Then she asked her trusted servant to take Snow White to the forest, far from the palace and kill her. But the servant did not kill Snow White, he let the innocent little girl go.
</p><p>In the forest, Snow White was alone and scared. She did not know where she was going. But suddenly she saw a strange little hut. She wondered who lived there, so she decided to enter the hut.
</p><p>Inside the hut, there were 7 beds and a kitchen. Snow White was very tired to look inside the hut, and suddenly fell asleep. In the afternoon, the seven dwarves who lived in the hut returned home. They were surprised to see a young woman there. One of the dwarves woke her up and asked who she was. Snow White told them her sad story. The seven dwarves also understood Snow White's feelings and asked her to stay with them in the hut.
</p><p>While in the palace, the servant returned and told Snow White's stepmother that Snow White had died. Then the stepmother asked the magic mirror once again who was the most beautiful in the country and still the magic mirror answered Snow White who lived in a small hut with seven dwarves was the prettiest. So the stepmother was angry and she planned something bad for Snow White.
</p><p>Then the stepmother disguised herself as an old woman who sold a basket of poisoned apples and went to the hut. At the hut, seven drawfts warned Snow White not to open the door for strangers.    </p><p>The stepmother finally arrived at the hut and started offering Snow White an apple. Snow White refused to open the door but the stepmother kept persuading and finally Snow White opened the door and bought an apple then she ate it. So that Snow White fell with the poisonous apple beside her.
</p><p>In the afternoon, when the seven dwarves returned, they were shocked by Snow White lying on the floor with a pale face and poisoned apple beside her. The seven dwarves were sad to see Snow White dying but not dead. Then seven dwarves decided to make a beautiful bed made of crystal to keep Snow White alive.
</p><p>Day after day, seven dwarves waited for a miracle to come when Snow White suddenly woke up. Then one day, there was a traveler who was actually a prince from a distant kingdom who saw a beautiful woman lying on a crystal bed. The traveler asked the dwarf what happened and the dwarf told the story.      </p><p><strong>3. Resolution</strong></p><p>Hearing the story of Snow White, the prince decided to take her to the Palace and ask the doctor to cure her. Then the prince kissed her to show his intention. But suddenly Snow White came back to life. The fact was that the prince's kiss destroyed the evil spell. Then the prince asked Snow White to marry him.
</p><p><strong>4. Reorientation</strong></p><p>Since then, Snow White had lived happily in a large palace. But from time to time, she often returned to visit the small cottage in the forest of the 7 beloved dwarves. </p><p></p><p><strong>PEMBAHASAN:</strong></p><p>Narrative text adalah teks yang bertujuan  untuk menghibur dan menarik minat pembaca dengan menyajikan cerita atau peristiwa yang memiliki masalah yang menimbulkan konflik dan pada akhir cerita ada resolusinya atau akhir yang bahagia atau bahkan menyedihkan. </p><p>  The generic structure</p>Orientation : latar belakang cerita, menjelaskan orang-orang yang terlibat dalam cerita, kapan dan dimana cerita itu terjadi

                        <p><strong>Narrative Text</strong></p><p>In the forest the fastest running animal is the <strong>rabbit</strong>. No one can beat him. The rabbit arrogantly posed a challenge to all forest dwellers to be able to defeat him.</p><p>When none of the other animals dared to accept his challenge, suddenly the turtle, which was known to walk very slowly, said he had accepted the challenge. One forest in unison laughed at him in disbelief. Moreover, the rabbit who was so arrogant underestimated the ability of the turtle.</p><p>On the day of the start of the match the <strong>rabbit </strong>began to show his ability to run very fast at the beginning of the match. The turtle began to walk quietly and slowly, as if ignoring the ability and arrogance of the rabbit.</p><p>The <strong>rabbit </strong>because he felt that he had the upper hand after running a long distance, he walked leisurely, then sat under a tree. The very cool wind apparently lulled the rabbit to sleep.</p><p>Apparently the <strong>turtle </strong>although walking very slowly but he never stopped. Until finally he passed the rabbit who was asleep under a tree.</p><p>Finally the rabbit woke up and chased the turtle, but unfortunately his efforts were in vain, because the turtle had already reached the finish line and became the winner. The rabbit realized his arrogance.</p><p>The <strong>fable </strong>above gives a message to us that high ability if not accompanied by humility will only produce arrogance. On the other hand, ordinary abilities but accompanied by perseverance will definitely produce real results.</p><p><strong>Questions</strong></p>Who was the fastest animal in the forest?What was the rabbit’s challenge?Why did the all forest laugh at the turtle?What did the rabbit do under the tree?How did the turtle defeat the fast rabbit?What can you learn from the story?Pembahasan<p>The <strong>story </strong>above is a part of <strong>narrative text</strong>. You can find <strong>narrative text</strong> in many forms, including stories: fictions and non fictions, fables, or biographies. </p><p>The best way to learn a <strong>narrative text</strong> is by reading many stories in English then answering questions about the text.

The rabbit's challenge was anyone who can beat him in speed. The all forest laugh at the turtle because he wanted to beat the fast rabbit with his slow speed. The rabbit fell asleep under the tree.

                        Aladdin and the Magic LampOnce upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.<br /><br />One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.<br /><br />Questions :<br />1. What is the type of the text?<br />2. What is the text about?<br />3. What is the purpose of the text?<br />4. What kind of generic structure will you find in the text?<br />5. What is the main idea of second paragraph?<br />6. What's in the magic lamp Aladdin asked?<br />7. What is given by the magician to Aladdin?<br />8. "He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it." (8th paragraph). What does the underlined word refer to?<br />9. "The name was Aladdin.

                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

Once upon a time there was a girl name Cindrella. She
lived with her bad step-mother and two step-sisters. She had to do all the
household chores.

One day the king invited all the ladies in the kingdom
to go to a ball (pesta dansa)  in the palace. He wanted to find the Crown
Prince a wife.

The step sisters went to the ball that night with
their mother. Cindrella was left alone. She cried because she actually wanted
to go to the ball, too.

Just then a fairy godmother came. With her magic wand,
she gave Cindrella a coach (kereta),
two horses and footmen. She also gave Cindrella a lovely dress to wear the ball
and a pair of glass slippers. She told Cindrella to come home before midnight.

At the ball, Cindrella danced all night with the
Prince. The Prince fell in love with her. At midnight, Cindrella ran home.
Unfortunately, one of her slippers slipped off at the door. She did not have
time to put it back on. The Prince was sad as he could not find Cindrella again
that night.

The next day, the Prince and his men brought along the
glass slipper. They went all over the Kingdom to search for the owner.

After searching for along time, finally, they came to
Cindrella’s house. The slipper fit her. The prince was very happy to find
Cindrella again. They got married and lived ever after.
